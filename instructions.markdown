# Rideways Frontend Techincal Test

Included with this test are 2 designs for the Rideways header.

From the included designs we would like you create the header in React.

On all devices the header bar has a button for selecting a language. (desktop-view.jpg)

Once this button is pressed, it highlights and displays a dropdown menu with a list of lanugages.

Each language is clickable to allow the language to be changed.

Each language also shows a flag and the name of the language.

The dropdown should be able to be scrolled so a small amount of the 21 available languages are shown.

On devices with a screen size of 480px or less then a fullscreen menu should be shown (mobile-view.png)

In the fullscreen view, a title is shown to explain the action and a close button is included on the far right to dismiss the dialog.

We would like to see examples of unit tests with your solution.
